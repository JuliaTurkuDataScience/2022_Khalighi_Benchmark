# FdeSolver: A Julia Package for Solving Fractional Differential Equations

This repository contains the benchmarking results between [FdeSolver.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/FdeSolver.jl), [FractionalDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalDiffEq.jl) and MATLAB solvers.

## How to navigate this repository

The benchmarking scripts are stored in the [_src_](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/benchmarking_FDE_Matlab_SciFracx/tree/giulio/src/julia) directory and include the following cases:

* Single dimension
* Multiple dimensions
* Random parameters
* ...

Preprocessed data used to plot the figures are available in the [_data_](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/benchmarking_FDE_Matlab_SciFracx/tree/giulio/data) directory, whereas raw data from the 6 benchmarks are found in the [_raw_](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/benchmarking_FDE_Matlab_SciFracx/tree/giulio/data/raw) subdirectory.

Figures can be generated by running the [_plot_figures.jl_](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/benchmarking_FDE_Matlab_SciFracx/blob/giulio/results/plot_figures.jl) script and are saved in the [_figures_](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/benchmarking_FDE_Matlab_SciFracx/tree/giulio/results/figures) subdirectory.
